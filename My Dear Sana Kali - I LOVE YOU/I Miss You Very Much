I can't believe that you left us today, you are one of my loving cows, I got a chance to take care of you till your third delivery, on 13th February you gave birth to a male calf, on Monday and Special day Sankaranti, it's a good day. You are a Simple and Beautiful cow. I love you very Much.
Due to our family disturbance cause, my mother was unable to take care of you and your calf so, Mamata Apa has taken care of yours.
Don't know why god is very selfish, he has taken you very soon, you are a young cow, single color Black,
Yo are Lucky for us, We think we are very unlucky because we are unable to take care of you properly.
Please Forgive me, my dear Sana Kali, you left us very soon, so for that I am feeling very Bad Today.
May your soul get the Correct Direction from God.
OM SHANTI SANA KALI.
We have two calfs, one is Mangu who was Born on 14th December 2021 (Tuesday), and Another one is Chandu who was born on 13th February 2023 (Monday), these 2 sons are signs of yours and memory of yours.

OM SHANTI
